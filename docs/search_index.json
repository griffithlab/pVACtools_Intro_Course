This is a cross-disciplinary challenge, involving genomics, proteomics, immunology, and computational approaches. We have built a computational framework called pVACtools that, when paired with a well-established genomics pipeline, produces an end-to-end solution for neoantigen characterization. pVACtools supports identification of altered peptides from different mechanisms, including point mutations, in-frame and frameshift insertions and deletions, and gene fusions. Prediction of peptide:MHC binding is accomplished by supporting an ensemble of MHC Class I and II binding algorithms within a framework designed to facilitate the incorporation of additional algorithms. Prioritization of predicted peptides occurs by integrating diverse data, including mutant allele expression, peptide binding affinities, and determination whether a mutation is clonal or subclonal. Interactive visualization via a Web interface allows clinical users to efficiently generate, review, and interpret results, selecting candidate peptides for individual patient vaccine designs. Additional modules support design choices needed for competing vaccine delivery approaches. One such module optimizes peptide ordering to minimize junctional epitopes in DNA vector vaccines. Downstream analysis commands for synthetic long peptide vaccines are available to assess candidates for factors that influence peptide synthesis. All of the aforementioned steps are executed via a modular workflow consisting of tools for neoantigen prediction from somatic alterations (pVACseq and pVACfuse), prioritization, and selection using a graphical Web-based interface (pVACviz), and design of DNA vector–based vaccines (pVACvector) and synthetic long peptide vaccines. pVACtools is available at https://www.pvactools.org. 1.2 Target Audience The course is intended for anyone seeking a better understanding of current best practices in cancer vaccine design and neoantigen prioritization using pVACtools. 1.3 Curriculum This course will teach learners to: Understand key concepts of immunogenomics and neoantigen identification How to run the pVACtools software suite How to visualize and prioritize neoantigen candidates with pVACview For more background on pVACtools please consult the core pVAC papers (Hundal et al. 2016, 2018, 2020).

It takes as inputs a pVACseq output aggregate report file (tsv format) and a corresponding pVACseq output metrics file (json). pVACview allows the user to launch an R shiny application to load and visualize the given neoantigen candidates with detailed information including that of the genomic variant, transcripts covering the variant, and good-binding peptides predicted from the respective transcripts. It also incorporates anchor prediction data for a range of class I HLA alleles and peptides ranging from 8 to 11-mers. By taking all levels of information into account for the neoantigen candidates, clinicians will be able to make more informed decisions when deciding final peptide candidates for personalized cancer vaccines. 3.3 Tour of the pVACview interface Here is a brief tour of the pVACview interface: "],["conclusions.html", "Chapter 4 Conclusions 4.1 Learning Objectives 4.2 Key conclusions 4.3 Additional Resources", " Chapter 4 Conclusions 4.1 Learning Objectives This chapter will summarize: Key conclusions of the course Additional learning resources 4.2 Key conclusions 4.3 Additional Resources "],["about-the-authors.html", "About the Authors", " About the Authors These credits are based on course contributors guidelines described here.     Credits Names Pedagogy Lead Content Instructor(s) Malachi Griffith, Obi Griffith Lecturer(s) Malachi Griffith, Susanna Kiwala Content Author(s) Susanna Kiwala Content Contributor(s) Huiming Xia Content Editor(s)/Reviewer(s) Malachi Griffith Content Director(s) Content Consultants Acknowledgments Production Content Publisher(s) Content Publishing Reviewer(s) Technical Course Publishing Engineer(s) Template Publishing Engineers Candace Savonen, Carrie Wright, Ava Hoffman Publishing Maintenance Engineer Candace Savonen Technical Publishing Stylists Carrie Wright, Ava Hoffman, Candace Savonen Package Developers (ottrpal) Candace Savonen, John Muschelli, Carrie Wright Art and Design Illustrator(s) Josh McMichael Figure Artist(s) Josh McMichael Videographer(s) Huiming Xia Videography Editor(s) Audiographer(s) Audiography Editor(s) Funding Funder(s) Institution/individual who funded course including grant number Funding Staff National Cancer Institute (NCI) U01CA248235 "],["references.html", "Chapter 5 References", " Chapter 5 References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
